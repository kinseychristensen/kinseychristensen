       <h4>Cubris</h4>
       <p>A mobile idle game where strategic choices determine your success or failure in building the largest cube.  Will you make 
        the right choice or will your blocks come tumbling down?

       <h4>Netherfield Ball</h4>
       <p>My very first coding project was a python choose-your-own-adventure game.  I would love to give it a fancy dressing up and play with cool UI options.</p>
       <h4>The Dozen Database</h4>
       <p>My family has a long history of silly videos but its becoming increasingly hard to keep track of home videos in the digital age.  I wamt to make a server that can be privately 
        accessed by family members to upload and share pictures and videos safely with each other only.</p>
