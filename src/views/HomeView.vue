    <h3>Hello!</h3>
<div class="about-me">
<p>My name is Kinsey and I have always been a collector of knowledge. I spent my childhood absolutely devouring the shelves of my local library, and as an adult I still have a deep hunger for learning about our incredible universe. One particular fascination for me has always been the power of language and how the words we choose can impact our world. Learning to code software has been an absolutely perfect extension of this long-held interest. Through studying at SNHU and Tech Elevator I've gathered experience and skills in object oriented programming, web development, database management. I've gotten to work with Java, C++ and Python. I can't wait to graduate and start looking for a new position where I can share my unique skills and strengths. 
</p>
<p>My experience working in team-oriented environments has helped me become very open to accepting and providing feedback. I can balance multiple tasks and produce content accurately and proficiently under tight deadlines. I produced two musicals while teaching a course load of seven unique classes! 
</p>
<p>I like to push myself to learn new programs and skillsets. I have the ability to change gears very quickly, thanks to my experience in the teaching field, and I especially excel at creative demands. I have been authoring a choose your own adventure web game in my free time that features three different endings and a series of badges that players can unlock for uncovering every character secret. 
</p>
<p>I have a very strong work ethic and am always searching out new projects and ways to assist my fellow co-workers. I bring a positive attitude and drive to work with me. I believe strongly in the power of peer mentorship and am so grateful for the mentors I have meet, and for the opportunities I have had to mentor in return. 
</p>
<p>I strive to be a voice for accessibility. There are so many ways we can impact the daily lives of people with disabilities and other marginalized groups by building better programs that extend access to all. I want to make the world a better, kinder, and more accessible space.
