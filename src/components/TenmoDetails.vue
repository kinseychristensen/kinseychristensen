       <h4>A Currency Exchange Server</h4>
       <p>
        Tenmo is a two way server to mimic a currency exchange service.  The project was created in IntelliJ using Java and PostgreSQL.  
        Utilizing object-oriented programming, Tenmo allows a user to register their account, initiate transfers, and approve transfer 
        requests from other users.  An internal log is kept to record all transactions.  Automated testing was also created for this system.

        This project was created as a pair assignment at Tech Elevator.
