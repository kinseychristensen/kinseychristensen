# Welcome to My GitHub! 👩‍💻✨
Hi there! I'm Kinsey Christensen — a former teacher turned software developer, accessibility advocate, and lifelong learner. My journey into tech started with a fascination for how small, thoughtful solutions can make a big impact. Today, I channel that same passion into creating meaningful, accessible, and innovative software. 💡

## 🚀 What I’m All About:

 - Problem-Solver Extraordinaire: Whether it’s debugging a tricky piece of code or designing a better user experience, I love rolling up my sleeves and diving into creative problem-solving.
 - Builder of Tools that Matter: I specialize in developing tools that empower others, like inFormative, a platform for tracking student growth, or Sweeter by the Dozen, a streamlined family recipe-sharing site.
 - Passionate About Learning: From Java to Vue.js and React, I’m always up for learning the next thing that makes tech more powerful and human-centered.

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On:

Right now, I’m perfecting Sweeter by the Dozen, a recipe-sharing website inspired by the love of family traditions and delicious food. It’s an exciting blend of Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js. 🍪👩‍🍳

I’m also exploring React and building a growing collection of projects that focus on interactivity, accessibility, and making technology kinder and more intuitive.

## 🌟 My Philosophy:

I believe that technology is a bridge — it can connect people, solve real problems, and empower marginalized voices. As a former educator, I know the power of mentorship and collaboration, and I’m passionate about creating programs and tools that extend opportunities for all.

## 🐾 A Little Extra About Me:

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me cozied up with a book, gaming with friends, or spending quality time with my cats (the true stars of my home office). I’m a cozy gamer, story enthusiast, and a firm believer that small kindnesses can change the world. 🌎💙

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my projects, contribute, or just say hello. Let’s build something amazing together! 🌟
